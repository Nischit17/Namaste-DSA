# 9. Palindrome Number

[Leetcode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)

## Palindrome

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same forward and backward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a `palindrome`, and `false` otherwise.

```
Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

```
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

```
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

```JS
NOTE

- To find last digit = n % 10

- To remove last digit = n / 10

var isPalindrome = function(x){
    if( x < 0) return false

    let xCopy = x;

    let rev = 0

    while(x > 0){
        let rem = x % 10
        rev = (10 * rev) + rem
        x = Math.floor(x / 10)
    }

    return rev === xCopy
}
```
